/**
 * The connectivity service can be used to determine whether the device is currently
 * connected to a network or not. The connectivity can be to any networking service,
 * i.e. WiFi, cell phone data, etc.
 *
 * <p>The ConnectivityService provides a read-only {@link #connectedProperty() connected property}
 * that is updated whenever the network connectivity of the device changes. A user of the
 * ConnectivityService can listen to changes of the network connectivity, by registering a
 * {@link javafx.beans.value.ChangeListener ChangeListener} to the
 * {@link #connectedProperty() connected property}.
 *
 * <p><b>Example</b></p>
 * <pre>
 * {@code ConnectivityService.create().ifPresent(service -> {
 *      boolean connected = service.isConnected();
 *      System.out.println("Network connectivity available? " + String.valueOf(connected));
 *  });}</pre>
 *
 * <p><b>Android Configuration</b></p>
 * <p>The permission <code>android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE</code> needs to be added.</p>
 *
 * Note: these modifications are handled automatically by <a href="https://docs.gluonhq.com/">GluonFX plugin</a> if it is used.
