     * vibration running for 2 seconds before stopping.</p>
     *
     * <p>If a pattern is desired, multiple durations can be provided, where each odd duration
     * represents a vibration duration, and each even duration represents an amount of time to wait.
     * For example, a call of {@code vibrate(1000, 1000, 2000, 2000, 3000)} will result in the
     * following pattern:</p>
     *
     * <ul>
     *     <li>Vibrate for 1 second</li>
     *     <li>Wait for 1 second</li>
     *     <li>Vibrate for 2 seconds</li>
     *     <li>Wait for 2 seconds</li>
     *     <li>Vibrate for 3 seconds</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * Note: the availability of this functionality is platform-restricted, and at present only Android supports it. 
     * Calling this method on iOS will result in the same vibration as calling {@link #vibrate()}
     *
     * @param pattern The pattern of durations to play the vibration for (with wait periods in between).
