/**
 * The PositionService provides details about a device's current location on
 * earth.
 *
 * <p>The PositionService provides a read-only {@link #positionProperty() position property}
 * that will be updated at regular intervals by the underlying platform implementation.
 * A user of the PositionService can listen to changes of the position by registering a
 * {@link javafx.beans.value.ChangeListener ChangeListener} to the
 * {@link #positionProperty() position property}.</p>
 *
 * <p>The service gets started by calling either {@link #start() } or
 * {@link #start(com.gluonhq.attach.position.Parameters) }, and can be stopped
 * at any time by calling {@link #stop() }.</p>
 *
 * <p>The desired accuracy can be modified by setting the proper {@link Parameters},
 * but the developer has to be aware of the risk of using higher precision, in
 * terms of battery consumption.</p>
 *
 * <p>The service can be used also in background mode</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Example</b></p>
 * <pre>
 * {@code PositionService.create().ifPresent(service -> {
 *      service.positionProperty().addListener((obs, ov, nv) ->
 *          System.out.printf("Current position: %.5f, %.5f",
 *              nv.getLatitude(), nv.getLongitude()));
 *      service.start();
 *  });}</pre>
 *
 * <p><b>Requirements</b></p>
 *
 * <p>The service requires the following changes on Android and iOS.</p>
 *
 * <p>However, these are handled automatically by the <a href="https://docs.gluonhq.com/">GluonFX plugin</a>,
 * when used.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Android Configuration</b></p>
 * <p>The permissions <code>android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION</code> and/or
 * <code>android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION</code> need to be added to the
 * Android manifest.</p>
 *
 * <p>For background updates, the service <code>positionBackgroundService</code>
 * has to be included as well. Note that in this mode the accuracy could be reduced
 * by the system.</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code <manifest ...>
 *    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION"/>
 *    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
 *    ...
 *    <service android:name="com.gluonhq.attach.android.AndroidPositionBackgroundService"
 *             android:process=":positionBackgroundService" />
 *    <activity android:name="com.gluonhq.attach.android.PermissionRequestActivity" />
 *  </manifest>}</pre>
 *
 * <p><b>iOS Configuration</b></p>
 * <p>Typically, the following keys are required:</p>
 * <pre>
 * {@code <key>NSLocationUsageDescription</key>
 *  <string>Reason to use Location Service (iOS 6+)</string>
 *  <key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
 *  <string>Reason to use Location Service (iOS 8+)</string>}</pre>
 *
 * <p>With Background mode enabled these are the required keys:</p>
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 *         <key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
 *         <array>
 *             <string>location</string>
 *         </array>
 *         <key>NSLocationUsageDescription</key>
 *         <string>Reason to use Location Service (iOS 6+)</string>
 *         <key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
 *         <string>Reason to use Location Service (iOS 8+) in background</string>
 *         <key>NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
 *         <string>Reason to use Location Service (iOS 8+) in background</string>
 * }</pre>
 * <p>Note that in this mode, UI updates are not allowed</p>
 *
