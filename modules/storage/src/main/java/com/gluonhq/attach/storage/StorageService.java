 * The storage service provides access to the private and public storage locations for

 * <p><b>Example</b></p>
 * <pre>
 * {@code File privateStorage = StorageService.create()
 *      .flatMap(StorageService::getPrivateStorage)
 *      .orElseThrow(() -> new FileNotFoundException("Could not access private storage."));

 * <p><b>Android Configuration</b></p>
 * <p>The permissions <code>android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</code> and
 * <code>android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</code> are required if you want to access the external
 * storage on the device for read and/or write operations respectively. Defining write permissions implicitly
 * activate read permissions as well.</p>
 *
 * Note: these modifications are handled automatically by <a href="https://docs.gluonhq.com/">GluonFX plugin</a> if it is used.
