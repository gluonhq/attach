/**
 * With the in-app billing service you can query information about in-app products and
 * purchases that were done and place new orders for those products.
 *
 * <p>Your application must be properly configured with the list of in-app products
 * when you want to use this service. The list of available in-app products must be
 * passed in first by {@link #initialize(String, List) initializing} the service. Each
 * registered product must have the identifier and type that matches the configuration
 * of your in-app product on iOS and Android. For your convenience, you should use the
 * same identifier for each product on both iOS and Android.</p>
