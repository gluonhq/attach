/**
 * AudioRecording Service.
 * 
 * <p>Service to record audio. The recording is saved in wav format in chunk files
 * of a given duration. The files are stored in the public storage, under a folder
 * that the developer will set. 
 * The pattern for these files name will be 
 * {@code audioFile-###-yyyy-MM-dd.HH-mm-ss.SSS,wav}, where ### is the number of
 * chunk, starting from 000.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Note that given the limited space available on the device, it is convenient
 * to remove the content either before starting a new recording or when the files 
 * have been extracted.</p>
 * 
 * <p><b>Dependencies</b></p>
 *
 * <ul><li>{@link StorageService Storage Service}</li></ul>
 * 
 * <p><b>Example</b></p>
 * 
 * <p>The following code snippet shows how to start recording 10 minutes of audio in 
 * 10 files of 1 minute duration each.</p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * {@code AudioRecordingService.create().ifPresent(audio -> {
 *      audio.clearAudioFolder();
 *      audio.getAudioChunkFiles().addListener((ListChangeListener.Change<? extends String> c) -> {
 *          while (c.next()) {
 *              if (c.wasAdded()) {
 *                  for (String fileName : c.getAddedSubList()) {
 *                      File audioFile = new File(audio.getAudioFolder(), fileName);
 *                      System.out.println("New audio chunk: " + audioFile.getAbsolutePath());
 *                  }
 *              }
 *              if (audio.getAudioChunkFiles().size() == 10) {
 *                  audio.stopRecording();
 *              }
 *          }
 *      });
 * 　　  audio.startRecording(44100f, 16, 2, 60);
 *  });}</pre>
 *
 * <p><b>Requirements</b></p>
 *
 * <p>The service requires the following changes on Android and iOS.</p>
 *
 * <p>However, these are handled automatically by the <a href="https://docs.gluonhq.com/">GluonFX plugin</a>,
 * when used.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Android Configuration</b></p>
 * <p>The following <code>permission</code> and activity need to be added to the 
 * android manifest configuration file:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code <manifest ...>
 *    ...
 *    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
 *    <application ...>
 *       ...
 *       <activity android:name="com.gluonhq.impl.attach.plugins.android.PermissionRequestActivity" />
 *    </application>
 * </manifest>}</pre>
 *
 * <p><b>iOS Configuration</b></p>
 * 
 * <p>The following keys are required:</p>
 * <pre>
 * {@code 
 * <key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
 * <string>Need microphone access for recording audio</string>
 * <key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
 * <array>
 *      <string>audio</string>
 * </array>
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * Note: to get access to the public storage from iTunes these keys can be added
 * as well:
 * <pre>
 * {@code 
 * <key>CFBundleDisplayName</key>
 * <string>$ApplicationName</string>
 * <key>UIFileSharingEnabled</key>
 * <string>YES</string>
 * }</pre>
 *
 * @since 3.5.0
