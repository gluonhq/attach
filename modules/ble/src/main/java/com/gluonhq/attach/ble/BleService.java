/**
 * <p><b>Beacons</b></p>
 *
 * The BLE scanner, which is short for Bluetooth Low Energy, can be used to communicate
 * with devices that are equipped with Bluetooth low energy wireless technology. After
 * scanning has started, a callback function will be called with a scanned result from
 * a detected nearby BLE enabled device. The scan result will contain the major and minor
 * values of the detected device, as well as its signal strength (rssi) and an approximation
 * of the proximity to the scanning device.
 *
 * <p><b>Example</b></p>
 * <pre>
 * {@code String uuid = UUID.randomUUID().toString(); // for example a known UUID of a beacon
 *  Services.get(BleService.class).ifPresent(service -> {
 *      service.startScanning(new Configuration(uuid), scanResult -> {
 *          System.out.printf("major: %d, minor: %d, proximity: %s",
 *                  scanResult.getMajor(), scanResult.getMinor(),
 *                  scanResult.getProximity().name());
 *      });
 *  });}</pre>

 *
 * <p><b>Devices</b></p>
 *
 * BLE devices are equipped with Bluetooth low energy wireless technology, such as
 * heart rate monitors and digital thermostats. This BleService can be added to
 * central devices (i.e. mobile device with Bluetooth enabled), to discover other
 * peripheral BLE devices. The central can request to connect to the peripheral so
 * it can explore and interact with its data. The peripheral is responsible for
 * responding to the central in appropriate ways.
 *
 * For more info about BLE see:
 * https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/generic-attributes-overview
 *
 * <p><b>Example</b></p>
 * <p>This code snippet shows how to discover devices:</p>
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * Services.get(BleService.class).ifPresent(ble -> {
 *        ble.startScanningDevices().addListener((ListChangeListener.Change<? extends BleDevice> c) -> {
 *            while (c.next()) {
 *                if (c.wasAdded()) {
 *                    for (BleDevice device : c.getAddedSubList()) {
 *                        System.out.println("Device found: " + device.getName());
 *                        device.stateProperty().addListener((obs, ov, nv) -> {

 * <p>This code snippet shows how to discover the characteristics for a given service:</p>
