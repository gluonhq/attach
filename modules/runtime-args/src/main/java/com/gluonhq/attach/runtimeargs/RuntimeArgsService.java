/**
 * The runtime args service allows for external events to be fired into Gluon Attach
 * applications - these events are either provided at startup time as runtime arguments
 * to the application, or they may be delivered at runtime by external services. Developers
 * may choose to observe these events by {@link #addListener(String, Consumer) adding a listener}.
 *
 * <p><b>Example</b></p>
 * <pre>
 * {@code Services.get(RuntimeArgsService.class).ifPresent(service -> {
 *      service.addListener("ALERT", value -> {
 *              // show alert(value)
 *      });
 *  });}</pre>
 *
 * <p><b>Android Configuration</b>:</p>
 *
 * To launch the app from a custom URL, like yourScheme://foo.html, register a
 * custom scheme in the AndroidManifest.xml file:
 *
 * {@code
    <activity android:name="com.gluonhq.impl.attach.plugins.android.LaunchURLActivity"
            android:launchMode="singleTask"
            android:configChanges="keyboardHidden|orientation|screenSize">
            <intent-filter>
                <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW"/>
                <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT"/>
                <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE"/>
                <data android:scheme="yourScheme"/>
            </intent-filter>
    </activity>
 * }
 *
 * To launch the app from a Local Notification, add the following to the
 * AndroidManifest.xml file:
 *
 *<pre>
 * {@code
 * <activity android:name="javafxports.android.FXActivity"
 *           android:launchMode="singleTop" ...>
 * </activity>

 *  <activity android:name="com.gluonhq.attach.runtime.android.impl.NotificationActivity"
 *            android:parentActivityName="javafxports.android.FXActivity">
 *       <meta-data android:name="android.support.PARENT_ACTIVITY"
 *                  android:value="javafxports.android.FXActivity"/>
 *   </activity>
 *   <receiver android:name="com.gluonhq.attach.runtime.android.impl.AlarmReceiver" />
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p><b>iOS Configuration</b>:
 *
 * To launch the app from a custom URL, like yourScheme://foo.html, register a
 * custom scheme in the plist file:
 *
 * {@code
    <key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
    <array>
        <dict>
            <key>CFBundleURLName</key>
            <string>your.java.package.YourScheme</string>
            <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
            <array>
                <string>yourScheme</string>
            </array>
        </dict>
    </array>
 * }
 *
 * To launch the app from another app, the latter has to
 * include in its plist file:
 *
 * {@code
    <key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
    <array>
        <string>yourScheme</string>
    </array>
 * }
 * </p>
