/**
 *
 * The ShareService provides a way to share content (text and/or files) from the
 * current app by using other suitable apps existing in the user device.
 *
 * <p><b>Example</b></p>
 * <pre>
 * {@code ShareService.create().ifPresent(service -> {
 *      service.share("This is the subject", "This is the content of the message");
 *  });}</pre>
 *
 * When sharing files, the Attach
 * StorageService can be used to create/read the file. Note that on Android, 
 * the file has to be located in a public folder (see 
 * StorageService#getPublicStorage), or sharing it won't be allowed. 
 *
 * <p><b>Example</b></p>
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * File root = StorageService.create()
 *           .flatMap(s -> s.getPublicStorage("Documents"))
 *           .orElseThrow(() -> new RuntimeException("Documents not available"));
 *
 * // select or create a file within Documents folder:
 * File file = new File(root, "myFile.txt");
 *
 * // share the file
 * ShareService.create().ifPresent(service -> {
 *      service.share("text/plain", file);
 * });
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p><b>Requirements</b></p>
 *
 * <p>The service requires the following changes on Android and iOS.</p>
 *
 * <p>However, these are handled automatically by the <a href="https://docs.gluonhq.com/">GluonFX plugin</a>,
 * when used.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Android Configuration</b></p>
 * <p>Create the file {@code /src/android/res/xml/file_provider_paths.xml} with
 * the following content that allows access to the external storage:</p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 *    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
 *    <paths>
 *        <external-path name="external_files" path="." />
 *    </paths>
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>And add this {@code provider} to the manifest, within the Application tag:</p>
 * <pre>
 * {@code <manifest package="${application.package.name}"  ...>
 *   <application ...>
 *       <provider
 *           android:name="android.support.v4.content.FileProvider"
 *           android:authorities="${application.package.name}.fileprovider"
 *           android:exported="false"
 *           android:grantUriPermissions="true">
 *           <meta-data
 *               android:name="android.support.FILE_PROVIDER_PATHS"
 *               android:resource="@xml/file_provider_paths" />
 *       </provider>
 *   </application>
 * </manifest>}
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p><b>iOS Configuration</b>: nothing is required, but if the app is sharing
 * images to the user's local gallery, the key
 * {@code NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription} is required in the app's plist file.
 *
 * Other similar keys could be required as well.</p>
 *
 * @since 3.4.0
